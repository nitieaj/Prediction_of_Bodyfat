### Description
### Context
Body fat prescription
### Null Hypothesis: 
There is no relationship between the percentage of body fat for an individual and the body density.

### Content
The variables listed below, from left to right, are:
1.	Density determined from underwater weighing
2.	Percent body fat from Siri's (1956) equation (class variable)
3.	Age (years)
4.	Weight (lbs)
5.	Height (inches)
6.	Neck circumference (cm)
7.	Chest circumference (cm)
8.	Abdomen 2 circumference (cm)
9.	Hip circumference (cm)
10.	Thigh circumference (cm)
11.	Knee circumference (cm)
12.	Ankle circumference (cm)
13.	Biceps (extended) circumference (cm)
14.	Forearm circumference (cm)
15.	Wrist circumference (cm)
(Measurement standards are apparently those listed in Benhke and Wilmore (1974), pp. 45-48 where, for instance, the abdomen 2 circumference is measured "laterally, at the level of the iliac crests, and anteriorly, at the umbilicus".)
